This is a proof of concept for an exploration-centric VR title. Explore The Factory, uncover it's hidden secrets (there are none), and try not to die (you can't die - you are perfectly safe). Once again THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT, not a completed game. I plan to build off of this for future games though, so check back regularly if you are fascinated by mobile VR.
